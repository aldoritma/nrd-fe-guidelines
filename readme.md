# Narrada Front-end Guidelines

### Description
This document contains the guidelines and best practices for the front-end web development team at [Narrada Communications](http://narrada.com). Each item here represents either:
1. A reminder to follow existing standards or industry conventions.
2. Guidance on what constitutes professional patterns and organization.
3. A decision we've made favoring one method over its alternatives.

What this document is not is a series of explanations as to how front-end technologies work; a basic familiarity is assumed. It also does not provide evaluations of the pros and cons of various alternatives unless there is common confusion about which option is best.


### Goals
Our motivations in creating this document are to:
1. Foster code consistency across our projects.
2. Facilitate ease of maintenance.
3. Ensure we create professional quality web sites.
4. Guide staff on-boarding or educate new developers.

This document is not intended to replace common sense, conventions requested by particular clients, teams, or prevent expressive or creative solutions to problems. Team or project-specific agreements or client requests will always supersede this document's content.
